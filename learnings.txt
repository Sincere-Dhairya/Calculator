Javascript:

1. in classes you declare constructor as
class name{
    constructor( arg1, arg2 ,...){
        ...
    }
    ...
}

best practice is to use 'this' keyword everytime we use class member inside any member function

'const' keyword is used to declare a new variable.

when you dont know how to initialize any variable, just assign 'undefined' to the variable.

=== means exactly equal.

parseFloat(string) method is used to convert the string into floating number.

isNaN(arg) method tells us if the argument is Null or not.

toString() method helps us convert a 'JavaScript Number' into a string.

.split(char) method of string breaks the string at all the position where there is the cahracter char in the string and returns an array of substrings which can be accessed using [0], [1], ... indices.

'let' is another keyword that helps us in declaring the variable.

toLocaleString() method returns language sensitive string

one of the short concatenating syntax is:
`${string1}{some other string or character}${string2}`
where string1 and string2 are the string variables being used in the program

document in JavaScript is something very big.
It is owner of all objects in our webpage.
document object itslef represents our webpage. If we want to start accessing any element in HTML page, we start it with document.

some of the commonly used methods of document are:
document.getElementById(id) -	Find an element by element id
document.getElementsByTagName(name) -	Find elements by tag name
document.getElementsByClassName(name) -	Find elements by class name

document.querySelector('.example') - gives us the first element in the document with class example.
similarly if we use attributes, we will use them as:
document.querySelector('[data]') - that gives us access to the first element in the document with class.

document.querySelectorAll() - gives all the elements in the document that satisfy given query.


forEach() is an array method that does certain defined operations to every element in the array.

document.querySelector.addEventListener ('action like click')
=> trigger the function that succeeds this operator when the given html element is being interacted by the user.
element.addEventListener(event, listener, useCapture); // gfg link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript-addeventlistener-with-examples/
